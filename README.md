step 1) build tokenizer to parse through tokens in a file
            -> this should be easy, just fscanf? Unless we're not allowed to use it
            -> nvm, professor says we have to use READ( ) function b/c we should get used to it early
            -> the tokenizer should be a function (can pass into nftw). 
            -> returns a sorted linked list of words and their frequencies (i guess we can make a bst or something if we hate ourselves)
            
            hmmm.....
            
            nftw() might have trouble returning a different structs from different files. 
            we could be extreeemely ratchet and write the contents of every single file into a "master" file, putting a key that  and then
