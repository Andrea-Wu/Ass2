Below are the description of the testcases we used. We have inlcuded the files and directories required for testing.
Each testcase addresses a certain functionality of our implementation.
-----------------------------

Testcase #1: a single file inside a directory without overlapping words. 
            To test the basic functionality of our tokenizer function.

Result:

-----------------------------

Testcase #2: two files inside a directory without overlapping words. 
            To test the functionality of our directory traversal function. 

Result:

-----------------------------

Testcase #3: two files inside a directory with some overlapping word.
            To test the functionality of our linked list implementation which keeps count for each repeating token under the same file name.

Result:

-----------------------------

Testcase #4: argv[1] is a directory
            To test false input handling.

Result:

-----------------------------

Testcase #5: argv[2] doesn't exits
            To test false input handling.

Result:

-----------------------------

Testcase #6: files with same name exists in different parts of a directory.
            To test our hash table implementation to handle repeating file names.

Result:

-----------------------------

Testcase #7: argv[2] is the invertedIndex.c itself.
            To test our implementation as a whole because it's simply another file, should not crash the program.

Result:

-----------------------------
